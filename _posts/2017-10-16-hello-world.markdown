Hi All, this is Vamsi from Bangalore. I have been working on rails for the past 2 years. I am so excited to do this blog post, as it will be my first blog post using jekyll platform.

So this blog will contain the "non typical" things, that we encounter in ruby/rails world, and how we do go about solving them.

If you find any mistakes, or would like to talk to me regarding work or non work, feel free to reach me here gvpmahesh@gmail.com
